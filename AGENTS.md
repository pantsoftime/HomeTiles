# HomeTiles Project Rules for Agents

This is the single authoritative agent rulebook for this repository. Every
agent must read it before inspecting, changing, building, or publishing code.
Do not create a second competing rule file.

## 0. Shared project context

- After this rulebook, read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` completely before inspecting,
  changing, building, or publishing code.
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` is the single shared state file for Codex, Claude, and
  other agents. It records current baselines, verified hardware facts, active
  problems, failed approaches, and pending validation; it is not a second
  rulebook.
- Update `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` in the same change whenever work materially
  changes one of those facts. Replace stale entries instead of appending a
  running diary.
- Keep shared context concise: no chat transcripts, raw logs, long build
  histories, or copied issue discussions. Keep it below 160 lines and 12 KiB.
- Do not create model-specific status, memory, or handoff files. Claude's
  `CLAUDE.md` is only a small import entry point for this rulebook and the
  shared context.

## 1. Scope, worktree, and user ownership

- Inspect `git status` and the relevant recent commits before editing.
- Treat every pre-existing tracked or untracked change as user-owned work.
- Preserve unrelated changes and untracked files. Never clean, reset, move,
  overwrite, stage, or delete them to simplify the task.
- Change only the requested feature, device profiles, and proven shared
  dependencies. Do not broaden the task into unrelated optimization work.
- Do not commit, push, tag, publish, create a release, or modify a remote
  system unless the user explicitly requests that exact action.
- Before a destructive or externally visible operation, verify the exact
  target and the user's authorization.

## 2. Communication and delegation

- Keep progress updates short, concrete, and useful.
- State what is being checked, what changed, what passed, and what still needs
  hardware validation.
- Do not claim that a compile proves runtime or hardware behavior.
- If a regression is reported, identify and correct the concrete cause before
  adding more features or speculative changes.
- Keep delegation minimal. Do not start background agents for ordinary UI
  work, small bug fixes, or tasks that can be completed directly.
- Never leave obsolete background agents running after their bounded work is
  complete.

## 3. English source, English logs, centralized UI translations

- Write all new or edited source-code comments in English.
- Write every runtime, diagnostic, debug, warning, and error log in English.
- Technical logs are never localized. Keep prefixes stable and rate-limit
  recurring logs so diagnostics do not create performance problems.
- Put every user-visible UI string in the central `Strings`/`LocaleProfile`
  schema in `src/core/i18n/i18n.h` and `src/core/i18n/i18n.cpp`.
- Never place display text directly in a renderer, popup, WebUI JavaScript,
  HTTP handler, MQTT handler, or protocol handler.
- Device UI and WebUI must consume the same central translations.
- Type-specific WebUI translations must be exported through that type's own
  `web_scripts.cpp`, following the established Climate implementation.
- Raw protocol values such as Home Assistant states (`open`, `closed`) and
  JSON keys remain stable English identifiers, but must be translated before
  display.
- Do not create renderer-local translation arrays, language-specific UI
  branches, or duplicate Web-only translations.
- When adding a language-dependent value, add it for every supported language
  and add a regression test that exercises the translated display path.

## 4. UI and visual consistency

- Use the exact existing HomeTiles component named by the user as the visual
  and behavioral reference. If none is named, choose the closest established
  component and state that choice.
- Match the reference component's layout, spacing, alignment, fonts, colors,
  radii, pressed states, touch behavior, and lifecycle before adding
  type-specific behavior.
- Do not invent a new visual language, control layout, or interaction model
  without explicit user approval.
- Use shared layout, font, color, and popup helpers whenever they exist.
- Device rendering, live Web Admin preview, and cached-grid Web Admin preview
  must show the same title, icon, state, values, colors, and geometry.
- Any deliberate device-specific visual difference must be guarded by the
  exact device profile and documented in English.
- Verify 1x1 tiles as well as supported multi-cell sizes. Long titles and
  missing values must clip or wrap like the reference component.

## 5. Complete contract for a new tile type

A tile type is not complete when it merely renders. All sections below are
mandatory.

### 5.1 Stable ID and persistence

- Append a new `TileType` value. Never renumber or reuse persisted IDs.
- Preserve `PackedTileV7` binary compatibility unless a deliberate, tested
  migration is part of the task.
- Add every reused `Tile` field to pack, unpack, reset, validation, migration,
  equality/no-op, and popup-mode allow-lists.
- If an entity or value can exceed its packed field, include the new type in
  the existing sidecar read, write, remove, rename, recovery, and no-op paths.
- Include the type in folder snapshots, cache rebuild, cache restore, cache
  reset/release, grid reload, copy/paste, import/export, and deletion paths.
- Distinguish absent, `null`, empty, zero, unknown, and unavailable values.
- Verify persistence with a fresh GET and a device reload/reboot path; a
  successful POST alone is not sufficient.

### 5.2 Type module and registry

- Follow the existing modular structure under `src/types/<type>/`:
  renderer, request handler, Web HTML, Web styles, and Web scripts.
- Add one complete `TileTypeDescriptor` with the correct stable type ID, CSS
  class, fields suffix, preview kind, renderer, request handler,
  `load/save/reset` functions, HTML, styles, scripts, and default color.
- Add localized type and entity labels through the central language schema.
- Add the type to every relevant registry, select list, allow-list, and
  dynamic MQTT route list.
- Compare the integration point list line by line with the closest mature tile
  type before declaring the implementation complete.

### 5.3 Web Admin HTML and entity options

- Generate unique tab-prefixed IDs for every field.
- Pass entity options through both the full page and lazy folder-tab fragment
  paths.
- Extend `/api/entity-options` for selectable entities.
- Preserve a configured value even when the current entity list is temporarily
  unavailable.
- The empty placeholder is not an entity and must never become the tile title.

### 5.4 Browser editor, preview, and autosave

- Implement `load<Type>Fields`, `save<Type>Fields`, and
  `reset<Type>Fields` using the exact server-side field names.
- Bind every editable field through the shared live-editor path.
- Every field change must update the preview, update the draft snapshot, and
  schedule autosave.
- Rebinding cached/replaced folder HTML must replace stale listeners instead
  of duplicating or losing them.
- Include every type-specific value in draft snapshots before POST.
- Support copy/paste and import/export with the same field semantics.
- Render both the selected live preview and the cached-grid preview.
- Browser JavaScript may call only browser-defined helpers. Firmware/C++
  helpers do not exist in the browser.
- Run the real preview branch in tests; do not stub away the code that failed
  in production.
- Escape untrusted titles, entity names, and metadata using the established
  WebUI escaping helpers.

### 5.5 HTTP save and firmware load

- POST type ID, title, icon, color, geometry, entity, popup mode, and every
  type-specific value to the established tile endpoint.
- Validate and apply the same field names in the type request handler.
- Preserve existing fields when a partial request is designed to do so, and
  clear fields only through an explicit reset/delete path.
- Verify save, reload, folder navigation, copy/paste, export/import, deletion,
  and reboot behavior.

### 5.6 Runtime state and cache integration

- Define a bounded state representation that preserves availability and
  optional values without conflating missing data with zero.
- Parse retained state payloads defensively and validate ranges.
- Add bounded/rate-limited queues and process them in the established loop
  locations for active and sleep modes.
- Add state application to root grids, folder grids, snapshots, cache restore,
  icon refresh, and entity refresh paths.
- Do not allocate or log per frame or per unchanged MQTT state.
- Release dynamically owned objects, event user data, queues, and cache data
  through the established delete/reset lifecycle.

### 5.7 Home Assistant and MQTT bridge

- Use official Home Assistant entity states, attributes, feature bits, and
  service semantics.
- Do not infer support from a current value when Home Assistant provides a
  `supported_features` mask.
- Add configuration flow selectors, stored configuration, tracked entities,
  metadata, state publishing, subscriptions, and unsubscribe/reload behavior.
- Use retained state where the existing bridge contract expects startup state.
- Validate entity IDs against configured entities.
- Use a fixed service allow-list; never pass an arbitrary service string from
  MQTT to Home Assistant.
- Clamp and validate numeric service arguments.
- Preserve compatibility with configurations that do not contain the new
  entity list.
- Add bridge tests for configuration migration, state payloads, unavailable
  entities, command validation, and every supported feature combination.

## 6. Popup implementation contract

- Use the popup explicitly named by the user as the design base. If the user
  says to base it on Light, start from `light_popup.cpp` and preserve its
  header, card, spacing, navigation, and interaction conventions.
- Use `popup_layout.h` for card size, margins, header coordinates, fonts,
  close button, body geometry, and scaling. Do not copy raw coordinates when a
  shared constant exists.
- Match the standard header: correctly aligned entity icon, localized title,
  and standard close button with the standard touch area.
- Reuse/preload popup objects according to existing lifecycle patterns; do not
  rebuild large object trees on every opening without evidence.
- Opening one popup must close conflicting overlays through the same mutual
  exclusion pattern used by existing popups.
- Add the new popup to preload, hide, reset, screen-change, sleep, and teardown
  paths.
- Keep all labels localized through central i18n. Logs remain English.
- Render only controls supported by Home Assistant feature bits. Never invent
  a service or enable a control whose feature is absent.
- Treat position, tilt, brightness, temperature, and other channels as
  independent when Home Assistant does.
- Preserve `null`/unknown values instead of displaying them as zero.
- For sliders, use the established optimistic-update, remote-update blocking,
  publish throttling, and guaranteed final-release behavior.
- A press action must trigger on release unless the established control
  requires continuous dragging.
- Verify popup layout and interaction at 480x480 and the affected larger
  layouts. Avoid device-specific branches unless the hardware truly requires
  them.
- Test repeated open/close cycles, unavailable transitions, state updates while
  open, navigation away, sleep/wake, and object cleanup.

## 7. Performance and memory

- Measure before changing shared UI or cache behavior.
- Avoid blocking network, storage, image decoding, or large memory copies in
  the LVGL timer/event path.
- Reuse established worker/queue patterns for expensive work; workers must not
  call LVGL unless protected by the project's established LVGL access model.
- Use bounded queues, bounded caches, and explicit ownership.
- Do not add permanent diagnostic history or large buffers when on-demand
  diagnostics are sufficient.
- Keep diagnostic output rate-limited and aggregate hot-path timings.
- Do not trade correctness or device stability for an unmeasured optimization.

## 8. Device profiles and shared code

- Guard device-specific fixes with the exact profile define.
- Do not guess GPIOs, panel timings, color order, byte order, clocks, memory
  capabilities, or partition parameters. Use exact-board primary sources.
- Shared-code changes require compile coverage for every materially affected
  profile requested by the user or required by the risk.
- Do not modify unrelated P4 or S3 behavior while working on one exact device
  profile.

## 9. Tests and verification before handoff

- Install pinned host dependencies after checkout or lockfile changes with
  `npm ci --ignore-scripts` before running tests or generating Web assets.
- Add a focused regression test for every reproduced bug. Name it
  `tools/tests/<area>/test-<topic>.mjs`; the CI suite discovers them recursively.
- Run the whole suite with `node tools/run-tests.mjs` (add name fragments to
  run a subset). A harness whose optional tooling is missing reports `SKIP:`.
- For a tile type, the browser contract test must cover type selection, entity
  selection, title editing, popup mode, preview, draft snapshot, autosave,
  form payload, and all localized runtime states.
- Run `node --check src/web/assets/admin.js` after editing Admin JavaScript.
- Regenerate compressed assets with `node tools/generate-web-assets.mjs` and
  verify them with `--check`.
- Run `git diff --check`.
- Compile all materially affected requested profiles.
- Record exact BIN paths, byte sizes, and SHA256 hashes.
- Clearly separate compile verification from tests that still require real
  hardware or Home Assistant.

## 10. Build workflow

- Run `node tools/run-tests.mjs` before firmware compilation.
- Use the normal incremental local build for iteration.
- Use `-Clean` only when explicitly requested or when a verified cache or
  toolchain problem requires it.
- Do not rewrite already patched toolchain archives on every build; verify and
  leave identical files untouched so compiler caches remain valid.
- Build only the profiles requested or materially affected by the change.
- Keep test artifacts in the established build directories unless the user
  asks for a separate package.

## 11. Commits, pushes, and releases

- Review the final diff and protected user files before staging.
- Stage only files that belong to the requested change.
- Use a focused English commit message.
- Push only after explicit user authorization.
- A push is not permission to create a release.
- Follow `RELEASING.md` and the established automated release format. Do not
  manually create a differently structured release.
- Update integration/manifest versions when required for an explicitly
  requested distributable update, and verify that HACS can detect it.
- Never publish untested firmware merely because it compiled.
