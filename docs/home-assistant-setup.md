# Home Assistant Setup Guide

This guide connects a HomeTiles display to Home Assistant, starting from scratch.
No YAML editing is required.

!!! note "What you need"
    - Home Assistant (any recent install type)
    - A display with the [firmware flashed](flashing.md)

The display never talks to Home Assistant directly. Everything goes through MQTT:

- The **bridge integration** pushes entity states, icons, weather forecasts, sensor history,
  and energy data to the display.
- The display sends commands back (light/switch/media/scene control), which the bridge
  executes in Home Assistant.
- Experimental camera popups use MQTT only for setup and control; display-sized
  JPEG frames travel directly over the local network.

So you need three things: an **MQTT broker**, the **bridge integration**, and the
**display firmware**. This guide covers all supported devices.

## Step 1: Set Up An MQTT Broker

If you already have a working MQTT broker, skip to Step 2.

The easiest option on Home Assistant OS is the official Mosquitto add-on:

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store**.
2. Search for **Mosquitto broker**, install it, and start it.
   Enable **Start on boot** and **Watchdog**.
3. Create a Home Assistant user for the display:
   **Settings → People → Users → Add user** (for example `display`, with a password of
   your choice). The Mosquitto add-on accepts Home Assistant users as MQTT credentials.
4. Set up the MQTT integration: after the add-on starts, Home Assistant usually discovers
   it automatically — go to **Settings → Devices & Services**, look for the discovered
   **MQTT** integration, and confirm it. If it is not discovered, add the **MQTT**
   integration manually and use `core-mosquitto` as the broker address.

## Step 2: Install The Bridge Integration

The bridge is a custom integration: [HomeTiles Bridge](https://github.com/GalusPeres/HomeTiles-Bridge)

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. **HACS → Integrations → three-dot menu → Custom repositories**
2. Repository: `https://github.com/GalusPeres/HomeTiles-Bridge`,
   category **Integration**, click **Add**.
3. Search for **HomeTiles Bridge** in HACS and download it.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

1. Copy the `custom_components/tab5_lvgl` folder from the bridge repository into your
   Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

## Step 3: Add The Integration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
2. Search for **HomeTiles Bridge**.
3. Keep the defaults unless you have a reason not to — the details (base topic,
   HA prefix) are explained on the [bridge page](bridge.md).

## Step 4: Get The Display Online

On the display, open **Settings → WiFi**. Either:

- pick your network from the scan list and enter the password with the on-screen
  keyboard, or
- tap **Enable AP**: the display starts a hotspot (password `12345678`, QR code shown
  on screen) — connect to it and enter your WiFi credentials in the captive portal.

## Step 5: Pair The Display

As long as the display has **no MQTT credentials configured yet**, it announces itself
on the network automatically. In Home Assistant, a **discovered device** card appears
under **Settings → Devices & Services** — confirm it, and the bridge pushes your MQTT
broker's credentials to the display. No typing required.

Afterwards the display shows up as a device under the bridge integration:

??? info "Manual alternative: enter MQTT settings yourself"
    If you prefer manual setup (or discovery is blocked in your network), open the
    display's web admin panel at `http://<display-ip>/` (the IP is shown in the
    on-device WiFi settings) and enter under **Settings → MQTT**:

    - **Host**: the IP address of your Home Assistant machine (when using the
      Mosquitto add-on, the broker runs there)
    - **Port**: `1883`
    - **Username / Password**: the Home Assistant user from Step 1
    - Leave **Device topic base** and **Home Assistant prefix** at their defaults
      unless you changed them in the bridge

    Save — the display restarts and connects to the broker.

!!! tip "Display missing in Home Assistant later?"
    The on-device **Settings → System → Pairing** button re-announces the display at
    any time — useful if you deleted the device in Home Assistant and want it back.

## Step 6: Choose What The Display Can See

Open the integration entry and click **Configure**. There are three sections:

- **Panel Settings** — base topic, HA prefix, and device metadata.
- **Entity Configuration** — pick the sensors, weather entities, lights, switches,
  media players, cameras, and scenes/scripts the display should have access to. Scene aliases are
  generated automatically; you can also map them manually (one `alias=entity_id` per line).
- **Energy Dashboard** — enable electricity, gas, and/or water. This requires the
  Home Assistant [Energy Dashboard](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/energy/) to be
  set up; the display's energy tile pulls its statistics from there.

Entity selections are shared across all panels — every display can use every entity you
pick here.

## Step 7: Build Your Dashboard

Open the display's [web admin panel](web-admin.md) and add tiles for the entities you
exposed in Step 6 — sensors, lights, weather, energy, media, scenes, and so on.
Changes appear on the display immediately.

For a Camera tile, install HomeTiles Bridge v0.6.28 or newer, select the camera
in Step 6, and ensure the display can reach the Home Assistant host on TCP
ports `8124`–`8131`. Camera support is experimental and available on ESP32-P4
targets only.

Optional local GPIO switches, onboard relays, and DS18B20 sensors are configured
on each panel's web-admin **I/O** tab instead of the shared Bridge entity
selection. They are immediately usable by tiles on that panel. HomeTiles Bridge
v0.6.32 or newer also adds them automatically to the corresponding Home
Assistant device; see [Local Hardware I/O](hardware-io.md).

## Multiple Displays

- Each display needs its **own base topic** (for example `hometiles`, `panel_kitchen`, ...) —
  set in the display's MQTT settings, or handled automatically during pairing.
- The **HA prefix stays the same** for all displays.
- Additional displays are discovered automatically: once the first panel is set up, any new
  display that connects gets its own integration entry without manual steps.

## Troubleshooting

**The display connects to WiFi but shows no data**

- Check the MQTT settings on the display (host, port, credentials).
- Make sure base topic and HA prefix match between the display and the integration entry.
- Check **Settings → Devices & Services** — the panel should be listed under the bridge
  integration. If not, tap **Settings → System → Pairing** on the display; it
  re-announces itself.

**No "discovered device" card appears**

- Discovery only runs while the display has no MQTT credentials stored. If it had some
  before, either use the manual setup above or factory-flash the device.
- If the device existed in Home Assistant before, delete the old device entry first —
  its ID survives a re-flash, and Home Assistant won't re-discover a known ID.

**Lights/switches/sensors are missing on the display**

- They must be selected in the bridge options first (Step 6), then assigned to a tile in
  the web admin (Step 7).

**The energy tile stays empty**

- The Home Assistant Energy Dashboard must be configured, and the matching category
  (electricity/gas/water) must be enabled in the bridge's Energy options.

**MQTT login fails**

- When using the Mosquitto add-on, the credentials are a regular Home Assistant user
  (Step 1), not an add-on-specific account.
